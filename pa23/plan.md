# PA23 Plan — deduction, substitution and SFINAE

## Stage Design

PA23 keeps the PA22 compiler and finishes the single-feature half of the
template layer: full function-template deduction, partial ordering, and
14.8.2p8's substitution failure as *candidate state* rather than as a
diagnostic. No new output format; the LowIR contract is PA13's.

Owners, in the order a use walks them:

- `ast_parser_class.cpp` — 14.1p3's abstract declarator and 10p1's
  `class-or-decltype`, whose operand tree the arena keeps beside its spelling.
- `sema_template_head.*` — 14.1p2's places, 14.1p9's defaults, the bound each
  was written under, and 14.3.3p1 of a whole settled argument list.
- `sema_deduce.{h,cpp}` — 14.8.2. `Deduction` reads the P/A pairs;
  `Substitution` is the *scope* one attempt at building the declaration runs
  in, and `Instantiated` is the error that escapes it.
- `sema_specialize.cpp` — 14.5.5.1p1's match, 14.5.5.2p1's ordering, 14.5.1p1's
  variable template and 14.5.7p1's alias.
- `sema_template.cpp` — 14.3p1's substitution (`substituted`), 14.7.1p1's
  instantiation, and `DependentReadings`: the constructs a pattern left
  standing, each with the region and the bound 14.7.1p1 reads it again under.
- `sema_scope.{h,cpp}` — 3.4's lookups, and 14.6.4.2p1's bound on them:
  `declared_serial` per namespace-bound declaration, `ReadingBound` per
  reading, `written_bound` per construct being recorded. Every definition
  14.7.1p1 reads again carries the bound it was written under - the pattern,
  each partial specialization's body, each out-of-class member definition, each
  body `template<>` wrote out, and each body a reading put aside.
- `sema_function.cpp` / `sema_template_signature.*` — 14.5.6.1p5 and
  14.5.6.2's ordering of two function templates.
- `sema_overload.cpp` — 13.3, which drops a candidate a deduction refused,
  gathers 13.3.1.4p1's converting constructors, and asks 14.6.4.2p1 of 3.4.1's
  half of a set and not of 3.4.2's. `sema_constexpr.cpp` draws the same line
  where a fold gathers a set of its own.
- `sema_layout.cpp` / `type_model.cpp` — 5.2.2p4's boundary, which reads
  12.8p12's copy, 12.4p8's destruction, 3.9.1p8's floating storage and 10.4p2's
  abstract class; and 8.3.2p5 / 8.3.4p1's *door*, which is the entry a
  declarator derives a type through as against the entry that interns one.
- `sema_expression.cpp` / `sema_lifetime.cpp` / `sema_init_list.cpp` — the
  refusals a substitution failure is made of: 5.7p1 and 5.2.6p1's completely
  defined pointee, and 8.5.4p7's narrowing of a clause through 13.3.3.1p4.
- `lowir_abi.cpp` — 14.2's encoding of an argument list.

## Current Failure Map

420 tests (405 handout + 15 course), 354 passing (handout-only 339 / 405). The
66 left, by the compiler behavior each wants:

| group | n | shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a call or name no declaration answers | 14 | the candidate a deduction or a substitution should have kept is dropped |
| LowIR text mismatch | 16 | the program compiles; the emitted LowIR differs |
| a wrong answer survives to a false `static_assert` | 6 | the refusal a substitution should make is not made at all |
| a value place still outside the read subset | 2 | a qualified alias and `typename` written at one |
| a pack the reading does not find | 2 | `Args is expanded and names no parameter pack` |
| a name in scope no reading finds | 3 | `invoke_result_impl<void,Args...>::type`, `T::pointer` |
| the rest | 23 | one-off clauses, one test each |

The `static_assert` group was eleven clauses and is six: the derivable types,
5.7p1's arithmetic, 8.5.4p7's narrowing and 14.3.3p1's kind mismatch landed
this turn. What is left under it has no shared owner — 5.2.4p1's
pseudo-destructor (whose `noexcept` the reference answers `true` and `g++`
answers `false`), 14.7.1p1's timing at a nested class, and three one-offs.

Known gaps diagnosed but not landed:

- **A global with an initializer is written per element by the reference and as
  one `zero n` run by us.** The collapse is PA13's and 152 earlier `.ref` lines
  hold `zero 1`.
- **14.6p2 at a reading a dependent context defers.** Widening the clause to
  every dependent prefix costs
  `pa20/course/pa20/100-a-decltype-an-argument-list-wrote-is-a-tree.t`.
- **A pack pattern in a partial specialization's own argument list.**
  `D<void_t<typename T::m...>, T...>` leaves the primary unsupported.
- **Two partial specializations reached through a non-deduced array bound are
  not ordered against each other.**
- **8.3.4p1's bound over a place is read in a class template's member and in an
  alias and not in a function template's parameter.**
- **8.3.5p8's function returning an array or a function is not refused**, so
  `T()` over `T = int[3]` derives a type `g++` refuses. The reference accepts
  it and no fixture writes it, so the refusal is not worth its risk yet.
- **14.1p4's fourth bullet has no layer below it.** A pointer-to-member place
  is refused because `int S::*p = &S::m;` is.
- **13.1's index cannot key a template declaration by what 14.5.6.1p5 asks**, so
  `declare_function` walks the chain: n declarations of one name is 0.80 s at
  n = 3200. The walk is PA22's.
- **8.3.6p9's default *function* argument is read at the call and not where it
  was declared.** `int g(int n = late());` above `int late();` is refused by
  both oracles and translated here with no template in the program at all, so
  the clause belongs to the declarator layer and not to 14.7.1p1's readings.
- **A static data member's *dependent* initializer is read past the class
  body**, so `static const int v = late(T())` reaches a `late` declared below
  the template. `g++` refuses it at the point of instantiation and the
  reference binary accepts it; a non-dependent initializer is read in the class
  body and is bounded.

## Active Checkpoint

**The refusals SFINAE has nothing to fire on.** Complete. The expression and
declarator layers accepted four things the standard refuses, so 14.8.2p8 had no
failure to drop a candidate on and every detector idiom written over them read
back the wrong answer.

- *Owner.* Four clauses, each at the layer that forms the thing:
  `TypeTable::derived_reference` / `derived_array` /
  `derived_substituted_array` are 8.3.2p5 and 8.3.4p1 - the door a *declarator*
  derives a type through, which the three readers that derive one all go
  through (the tree walk in `sema_declarator.cpp`, the flattened-spelling
  reader in `sema_type_id.cpp`, and 14.3p1's substitution in
  `sema_template.cpp`). `TypeTable::is_abstract_class` is 10.4p2 as a fact of
  the type, settled by `settle_virtual_members` where the vtable pass already
  answers it. `sema_expression.cpp` owns 5.7p1's and 5.2.6p1's *completely
  defined* pointee. `sema_lifetime.cpp` owns 8.5.4p7 through 13.3.3.1p4 - the
  clause a list-initialization hands a constructor - and `sema_init_list.cpp`
  the fourth bullet's own reading of it. `TemplateHead::require_matching_
  arguments` is 14.3.3p1, asked at `instantiate_class` where every settled
  argument list meets the head.
- *Data flow.* The three interning entries (`reference_to`, `array_of`,
  `substituted_array`) stay what they were, because the table interns synthetic
  types no declarator wrote: 13.1's key for a member function spells its
  ref-qualifier as a reference to `cv void`, and 14.8.2.1p3 derives a reference
  to stand a deduction's argument up as an lvalue. Putting the refusal in the
  table refused 24 tests that write neither. So the refusal is at the door and
  the keys go around it. 14.3.3p1 reads the head off the argument two ways: an
  argument a lookup found is the interned template-name entry, and one a
  substitution settled is the class the template's own pattern declared -
  `T::template member` is a dependent name no reading of the pattern could look
  up, which is why the clause had never been asked of it.
- *Expected complexity.* Two type comparisons per derived array or reference,
  on a path that already interns one node; one `is_incomplete` per pointer
  operand of `+`, `-`, `++` and `--`; one comparison per template place of a
  head, and only where a specialization is being made. 8.5.4p7 asks the fold
  only where its exception could change the answer - not for an integral clause
  reaching an integral parameter with room for it, which is `W w{ g(x) + g(y) }`
  and nearly every clause a program writes - so the narrowing sweep costs the
  same as the pre-checkpoint binary rather than 30% more.
- *Validation.* 90 derivation shapes (10 declarator forms x 9 argument types)
  against both oracles, agreeing with the reference on 87 and with `g++` on 84;
  25 shapes of 14.3.3p1 reached five ways, agreeing with the reference on 24;
  48 narrowing shapes through a constructor plus 14 scalar ones, agreeing with
  `g++` on all but matching the reference only where the reference implements
  8.5.4p7 at all; `through-pa22` at 2948 / 2948; valgrind clean over 65 inputs;
  no `rc > 1` over the corpus; corpus 1.91 s against the baseline's 1.90 s.

Three divergences the sweeps found and this checkpoint keeps, each standard-
correct and pinned by no fixture: `typedef abstract_class a[2];` is refused
here and accepted by both oracles (8.3.4p1 names an abstract class element
outright; `g++` defers the same refusal to object creation, and the reference
makes it at a deduction site and not at a typedef); `unsigned u{-1}` and
`short s{40000}` are refused here and by `g++` and accepted by the reference,
which implements no 8.5.4p7 for either; and a function type derived over
`T()` where `T` is a function or an array is accepted here and by the reference
and refused by `g++` (8.3.5p8), which is left alone because the reference is
PA23's oracle and no fixture writes it.

## Next Substantial Checkpoint

**The candidate a deduction or a substitution should have kept**, which is the
14-test group whose shape is `no declaration of X accepts the arguments of a
call`. It is the largest group left and the one the LowIR mismatches sit
behind. The cheapest coherent bundle inside it is the three tests whose name a
*reading* cannot find at all - `invoke_result_impl<void,Args...>::type` twice
and `T::pointer` once - because all three are one question: a member of a
partial specialization reached through a pack the primary's own argument list
wrote, which the plan already records as a known gap.

## Performance Model

Measured on this turn's binary against a `/tmp` worktree of `506a7ca4` built the
same way, warm cache, `/usr/bin/time` on the binary itself. A loop that spawns
`timeout` per run reads the same corpus as 45.9 s against 2.6 s, which is the
wrapper's process floor and not the compiler's; a corpus pass run while a second
build saturates the machine reads 5.8 s against 1.9 s, which is that build's.

Why 14.6.4.2p1's bound stays flat: it is one `std::uint32_t` written where a
definition is recorded and put back by a two-assignment scope where it is read,
so a body costs one of each however many times it is read; `find` asks one
comparison per namespace lookup and only where a bound is set at all, and the
candidate walk asks one per entry on the 3.4.1 side of a set whose size it
already has. 14.1p9's stand-in is one entity per (spelling, region), memoized by
`default_arguments_`, so a template named n times the same way reads its default
once. 3.9.1p8's floating fact is settled by the walk that already reads every
base and member. The one quadratic is PA22's `TemplateSignature::equivalent`
chain walk, named under the known gaps.

Why this checkpoint's four clauses stay flat: three of them are a fixed number
of type comparisons on a path that already interns a node or already walks a
pointee, so they cost per *use* and never per program. 14.3.3p1's is one
comparison per template place, and only where a specialization is being made -
a second naming of the same argument list is the held entry the caller already
found. 8.5.4p7's is the one that could have scaled, because its exception needs
the clause folded: the fold is asked only where the bullet could fire at all,
so an integral clause reaching an integral parameter with room for it - which
is nearly every clause a program writes - pays nothing, and the ungated form
read 0.09 s where the gated one reads 0.07 s at n = 1024.

## Completed Checkpoints

| # | checkpoint | owner | what landed | measured |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 14.8.2p8: substitution failure is candidate state | `sema_deduce.{h,cpp}`, `sema_template.{h,cpp}`, `sema_specialize.cpp`, `sema_analyzer.{h,cpp}`, `sema_function.cpp`, `sema_declarator.cpp`, `sema_scope.{h,cpp}`, `ast_model.h` | `Substitution` scope around all three deduction entry points and around the written-argument-list `specialize`, so a refusal discards the candidate; `Instantiated` marks a refusal from an instantiated class body; 14.1p3's unnamed *type* place; a dependent value argument keeps its spelling, place and region; `substituted_region`; `dependent_member_type` rebuilt over the class *this* substitution made; 14.5.6.1p5 rather than 13.1's index pairs two declarations; 14.8.2.1p4's qualification conversion; 14.6p2's `typename` over a bare place | 246 → 292 / 400; through-pa22 2948 / 2948 |
| 2 | 14.3.2p1: an address argument is which object it designates | `sema_template_head.{h,cpp}`, `sema_value_expression.cpp`, `sema_expression.cpp`, `sema_constexpr.cpp`, `ast_parser_class.cpp` | 14.1p4's second and third bullets and 14.1p8's adjustment; 14.3.2p5 over 5.19p2's `ConstantAddress`; 14.3.2p1's linkage and 14.3.2p3's subobject refusals; `&` and `nullptr` in the spelling reader; 4.3p1's function name; 14.1p3's *abstract* declarator; 3.2p3's demand for the definition an argument names | 292 → 299 / 400, plus 5 course fixtures; 30-shape sweep agrees with the reference on all |
| 3 | 14.8.2p8 at 14.5.5.1p1's match, and 10p1's `class-or-decltype` | `sema_specialize.{h,cpp}`, `ast_parser_class.cpp`, `sema_derivation.cpp` | `Specialization::matches` runs `match_arguments` and 14.8.2.5p5's read-back inside one `Substitution` - the whole detector idiom; 14.5.5p8.3's unbound place moved out of that scope; 10p1's base written as a decltype-specifier has its operand read and kept | 304 → 314 / 405; 11-shape base sweep agrees with `g++` |
| 4 | 13.3.1.4p1's converting constructor is a template too | `sema_overload.cpp` | a constructor template is a candidate through the specialization the one argument deduces, with 12.3.1p2's `explicit` and 8.4.3p1's deleted asked of the template; 13.3.3p1's last tie-break, so the non-specialization wins a tie | 314 → 319 / 405; 11-shape sweep agrees with `g++` |
| 5 | 14.6.2p2's variable template, and a prefix the arguments settled | `sema_specialize.cpp`, `sema_template.cpp`, `sema_type_id.cpp`, `sema_deduce.cpp` | a naming of a variable template under an outer head gives back a declaration typed by a stand-in, held against the interned list; a settled non-class prefix refuses where 14.8.2.5p5's read-back took it for agreement; 8.3.4p1's bound written over a place is 14.8.2.5p5's non-deduced context | 319 → 324 / 405, plus 4 course fixtures; 15-shape and 6-shape sweeps agree with both oracles |
| 6 | audit: 14.3.2p1's address argument has a fourth reader | `type_model.{h,cpp}`, `lowir_abi.cpp`, `abi_mangle.cpp`, `sema_template_head.{h,cpp}`, `sema_value_expression.cpp` | the encoding names the declaration an address argument designates rather than this unit's table entry, so two units writing `at<&left>` write one definition; `reaches_place` is 14.3.2p5's own conversion list, asked before 8.5's; 14.1p4's fifth place; 13.4p1's target at a function place | 328 / 409 → 332 / 413; 11-shape mangling cross-product identical to the reference |
| 7 | the second reading a substitution makes: the tree, the region and the bound | `sema_declaration.h`, `sema_template.{h,cpp}`, `sema_template_head.cpp`, `sema_deduce.cpp`, `sema_scope.{h,cpp}`, `sema_overload.cpp`, `sema_operator.{h,cpp}`, `sema_argument_lookup.cpp`, `sema_analyzer.{h,cpp}`, `sema_layout.cpp`, `type_model.{h,cpp}` | 14.1p9 at a value place over a list an argument has yet to settle was *evaluated* against a dependent prefix and refused the program - `dependent_default` keeps the tree and the region and 14.7.1p1 evaluates it where the arguments arrive, which is the third form of `DependentDecltype`. 14.6.4.2p1: every reading a pattern left standing was made again against the *whole* unit, so an object declared later under the name of a hidden friend suppressed 3.4.2 and a later overload joined a set - `declared_serial` and `ReadingBound` put 3.4.1's half of such a reading back at the definition context, while 3.4.2's searches and every instantiated body run under none. The sibling sweep found the same gap at both tiers of 14.1p9's own default, which is read at the naming and not through a stand-in, so both carry the bound too. 5.2.2p4: a class of two words or less holding a floating scalar crosses by address in the reference and as its bytes here, which is 3.9.1p8 over the storage the layout walks and had no reader at all. `DependentReadings` and 14.5.6.2's ordering moved to their owners to make the room | 332 / 413 → 338 / 413, plus 3 course fixtures (341 / 416); through-pa22 2948 / 2948; 45 + 30 + 32 sweep shapes against `g++` and the reference; corpus 1.94 s against the baseline's 1.95 s |
| 8 | audit: what a body read again may name | `sema_template.{h,cpp}`, `sema_declaration.h`, `sema_scope.h`, `sema_function.cpp`, `sema_analyzer.cpp`, `sema_pattern.cpp`, `sema_specialize.cpp`, `sema_explicit.cpp`, `sema_constexpr.{h,cpp}`, `sema_constexpr_object.cpp`, `sema_expression.cpp` | 14.6.4.2p1's bound had landed for the three readings a pattern interns and was written as *no bound at all* at `instantiate_body` and `complete_specialization` - so a template body reached the whole unit, `pick(long)` above a pattern and `pick(int)` below it ran to `pick(int)` where `g++` runs to `pick(long)`, and `f(T t) { return late(t); }` above `int late(int);` was a program both oracles refuse and this build translated. The bound is a fact of each definition now: `TemplateInfo::visible`, `Partial::visible`, `Member::visible`, `WrittenBody` for the bodies `template<>` wrote out, and `PendingDefinition::visible` for the body a reading put aside - each reading setting its own at entry, taken after the definition's first reading so 11.3p1's friend and the template's own name stay reachable, and recorded through `written_bound` so a nested definition does not inherit the unit. `ConstexprReading::selected` draws 3.4.1's line against 3.4.2's, which is the gap the plan had recorded as reaching no fixture and which ran a fold to 200 against both oracles' 100. 1.4p8's reserved name stands before the unit rather than at the use that declared it | 341 / 416 -> 343 / 417; through-pa22 2948 / 2948; 23 + 28 + 10 sweep shapes against `g++` and the reference; corpus 2.06 s against the pre-audit binary's 2.03 s |
| 9 | the refusals SFINAE has nothing to fire on | `type_model.{h,cpp}`, `sema_declarator.cpp`, `sema_type_id.cpp`, `sema_template.cpp`, `sema_template_head.{h,cpp}`, `sema_virtual.cpp`, `sema_expression.cpp`, `sema_lifetime.cpp`, `sema_init_list.cpp`, `sema_overload.cpp`, `sema_analyzer.h` | four things the standard refuses and the layers below accepted, so 14.8.2p8 had no failure to drop a candidate on. 8.3.2p5's reference to void and 8.3.4p1's array of a reference, of void, of a function and of an abstract class now go through one *door* - `derived_reference` / `derived_array` / `derived_substituted_array` - that all three readers that derive a type call, while the interning entries stay open for 13.1's key and 14.8.2.1p3's stand-in, which is what the first landing of this rule broke in 24 tests. 10.4p2 became a fact of the type, settled where the vtable pass already answers it, so a substitution reaches it without a scope. 5.7p1 and 5.2.6p1 read the pointee as *completely defined*, which is `void *` and a class the unit only declared. 8.5.4p7 measures the clause a list-initialization hands a constructor, and its fourth bullet's round trip now asks whether the destination *represents* the value rather than whether the bits came back - `-1` reached `unsigned` and came back as `-1`. 14.3.3p1 is asked at `instantiate_class`, the one place every settled argument list meets its head, because `helper<T::template member>` is an argument no spelling looked up and no deduction bound. 4.10p2's `void *` reads 3.9.3p5's qualification, which an array carries on its element | 343 / 417 -> 354 / 420 (handout 331 -> 339 / 405); through-pa22 2948 / 2948; 90 + 25 + 48 + 14 sweep shapes against `g++` and the reference; corpus 1.91 s against the pre-checkpoint binary's 1.90 s; valgrind clean over 65 inputs |
