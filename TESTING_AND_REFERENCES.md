# Testing And References

Run build and test targets from the repository root unless a PA handout says to
use a narrower command.

## Common Root Targets

```sh
make build
make test
make test-paN
make test-report-through-paN
make test-report
make test-strict
make inception
```

- `make build` builds the compiler tools in `dev/`.
- `make test` builds once, then runs the assignment tests.
- `make test-paN` runs one assignment.
- `make test-report-through-paN` runs the report suite through PA N.
- `make test-report` runs the broad keep-going report.
- `make test-strict` runs stricter suites used by selected later assignments.
- `make inception` runs the final PA39 self-host comparison.

The exit criterion for PA N is a clean root `make test-report-through-paN`.

## Assignment-Local Targets

Inside an assignment directory:

```sh
make
make test
make check TEST=tests/path/to/case.t
make check TEST='tests/path/to/100-*.t'
make check TEST='tests/path/to/a.t tests/path/to/b.t'
```

`TEST=` accepts one checked-in test file, a quoted shell glob, or a quoted
space-separated list of files and globs. Later assignments with multiple test
kinds can route mixed entries to the right local runner, for example a
preprocessor case plus a compile case. Use local targets for quick iteration,
then return to the root through target before considering the assignment
complete.

## Compiler Selection

You may pass compilers explicitly:

```sh
make CXX=g++ CPPGM_HOST_CXX=g++
```

For normal host builds, `CXX` and `CPPGM_HOST_CXX` should usually match. For
PA39 self-host work, `CXX` may be `../dev/cppgm++` while `CPPGM_HOST_CXX`
remains a real host compiler.

## Test Locations

- Assignment-local tests live in `paN/tests/`.
- Shared course tests live in `cppgm.tests/course/paN/`.
- Later PA handouts may describe additional folders such as strict, debuginfo,
  object-inspection, or link tests.

Add focused regression tests for new bugs. Put shared student tests under
`cppgm.tests/course/paN/` when they should travel with the course-wide harness;
put PA-local tests under `paN/tests/` when they are specific to one assignment.

## References

Reference outputs, stdout refs, exit-status refs, and inspect refs are the test
oracle. Do not edit them to hide an incomplete implementation.

Reference binaries such as `pptoken-ref` or `cppgm++-ref` are provided for
observing expected behavior and regenerating reference fixtures. They must not
be used by your compiler implementation.

The reference binaries are not perfect. Only checked-in fixtures gate an
assignment. Synthesizing new inputs is fine, but reference behavior outside
the test suites is intended to be correct, not guaranteed; prefer the handout
and the standard over exact reference parity. Error message text is never
compared: failing tests check only the exit status.

Failed-case stdout files are generated on the Linux export host and retained
as informative examples for students. They are not portable reference oracles
and are therefore not tracked in the compiler source repository. Successful
stdout files remain exact checked-in references.

The repository does not store the large binary payloads in Git. The checked-in
`*-ref` wrappers automatically download, verify, and unpack the pinned
reference-binary bundle the first time a reference tool is needed. To fetch the
bundle before running a ref target, use:

```sh
make reference-binaries
```

The ref regeneration targets use the provided reference binaries:

```sh
make ref-test-paN
make -C paN ref-test
```

These targets intentionally fail if the needed reference binary cannot be
downloaded or verified. There is no fallback to the implementation under test.

## Strict And Debug Fixtures

Some later assignments include optional stricter comparisons, witness fixtures,
debug-info fixtures, or object/link inspection checks. Run the targets named in
the PA handout when you touch that surface. The broad root commands are:

```sh
make test-strict
make ref-test-strict
make ref-test-debuginfo
```

Strict/reference regeneration is for maintaining fixtures from the provided
reference tools, not for making current incorrect output pass.

Strict witness comparison is byte-exact. The compact public witness format
canonicalizes both internal `ensure-definition` and `require-definition`
lifecycle events as `require-definition`, because they are the same observable
definition demand and their distinction depends on compiler scheduling. Raw
patched-Clang JSON and debug witness output retain the original event kinds and
provenance for investigation.
